# Instructions 

Create 2 files one called .env.test and one called .env.development

Inside .env.test put PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
Inside .env.development put PGDATABASE=nc_news

Then add .env.test and .env.development to the .gitignore file so you protect the information from others also

Doing as stated above will allow you to connect to the two databases locally
